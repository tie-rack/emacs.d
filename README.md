# emacs.d

This is my Emacs configuration. There are many like it, but this one
is mine.

## Set up

1. Clone into ~/.emacs.d
2. Enjoy

## History

When I upgraded to Emacs 24, I decided I'd start using ELPA and so it
was a good time to start my .emacs.d all over.  So I ditched my old
one and made this.

Then I read and really enjoyed some org-mode literate configs, so I
made another big change.

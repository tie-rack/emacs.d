# emacs.d

This is my Emacs configuration. There are many like it, but this one
is mine.

## Set up

1. Clone into ~/.emacs.d
2. Enjoy

## History

When I upgraded to Emacs 24 in 2012 I decided I'd start using
packages instead of copying and pasting from EmacsWiki, so I started a
new configuration from scratch.

Then I read and really enjoyed some org-mode literate configs, and
tried that out in 2014.

In a bout of cabin fever in 2020 I pared it way back and dropped the
literate style.

I imagine in 2024 I will burn it down again and see what grows from
the ashes.
